# Sentence Analyzer Feature

## Overview

The Sentence Analyzer is a specialized AI feature that provides sentence-level analysis separate from the main chat AI. It's designed to help users understand complex sentences, technical jargon, and difficult concepts by providing focused, concise analysis.

## How It Works

### 1. **Text Selection**
- Users can select any sentence or text in AI responses
- The contextual lookup popup appears with the selected text
- A new "AI Analyzer" tab is available for sentence analysis

### 2. **Separate AI Endpoint**
- Uses a dedicated API endpoint: `/api/sentence-analyzer`
- Different AI personality from the main documentation assistant
- Focused on sentence analysis and comprehension
- Shorter, more focused responses (150 tokens max)

### 3. **Analysis Types**
- **üìù Summarize**: Condenses complex sentences into simple language
- **üîç Simplify**: Breaks down technical jargon into understandable terms
- **üí° Explain**: Provides explanations and alternative phrasings

## Features

### **Quick Analysis Button**
- Appears in the popup header when text is long enough (10+ characters)
- One-click access to AI analysis
- Automatically switches to the AI Analyzer tab

### **Smart Text Detection**
- Only shows analysis options for sentences with sufficient length
- Provides helpful feedback for short selections
- Maintains context awareness

### **Real-time Processing**
- Shows loading spinner during analysis
- Displays results immediately when ready
- Timestamps for analysis tracking

## API Details

### **Endpoint**: `/api/sentence-analyzer`

### **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "sentence": "The selected text to analyze",
  "analysisType": "summarize" // or "simplify", "explain"
}
```

### **Response**:
```json
{
  "response": "AI analysis result",
  "analysisType": "summarize",
  "originalSentence": "Original selected text",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### **AI Personality**:
- **Specialized**: Focuses only on sentence analysis
- **Concise**: Provides 2-3 sentence responses
- **Educational**: Helps with learning and comprehension
- **Different Tone**: Distinct from general documentation assistant

## Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Technical Jargon**
**Selected Text**: "The API endpoint utilizes OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT tokens for secure access control."

**Analysis Type**: Simplify
**Result**: "This means the website uses a secure login system called OAuth 2.0, which creates special access cards (JWT tokens) to keep your information safe."

### **Example 2: Complex Concept**
**Selected Text**: "The middleware intercepts HTTP requests, processes them through authentication filters, and applies rate limiting before routing to the appropriate handler."

**Analysis Type**: Summarize
**Result**: "The system acts like a security checkpoint that checks requests, verifies users, controls traffic flow, and directs requests to the right place."

### **Example 3: Documentation Language**
**Selected Text**: "The function implements a recursive algorithm that traverses the binary tree structure using depth-first search methodology."

**Analysis Type**: Explain
**Result**: "This function uses a method that explores a tree-like data structure by going deep into each branch before moving to the next one, repeating this process for each part."

## Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Components**:
- `ContextualLookup.js`: Main popup component
- New "AI Analyzer" tab with analysis options
- Quick analysis button in header
- Loading states and result display

### **Backend Services**:
- `sentence-analyzer.js`: Dedicated API endpoint
- Separate OpenAI configuration for sentence analysis
- Custom system prompts for specialized behavior

### **State Management**:
- `sentenceAnalysis`: Stores analysis results
- `isAnalyzingSentence`: Loading state management
- `activeTab`: Tab navigation control

## Benefits

### **For Users**:
- **Quick Understanding**: Get immediate clarification on complex text
- **Learning Aid**: Better comprehension of technical concepts
- **Time Saving**: No need to ask the main AI for simple explanations
- **Contextual Help**: Analysis appears right where you need it

### **For Developers**:
- **Separate Concerns**: Different AI personalities for different tasks
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new analysis types
- **Maintainable**: Isolated functionality
- **Customizable**: Different prompts and behaviors

## Future Enhancements

### **Planned Features**:
- **More Analysis Types**: Translation, sentiment analysis, grammar checking
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple sentences at once
- **Custom Prompts**: User-defined analysis instructions
- **History Tracking**: Save and review previous analyses
- **Export Options**: Save analysis results to notes

### **Integration Possibilities**:
- **Code Comments**: Analyze and simplify code documentation
- **Error Messages**: Explain technical error messages
- **API Responses**: Clarify API documentation and responses
- **Learning Paths**: Suggest related concepts and resources

## Configuration

### **Environment Variables**:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### **API Settings**:
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini` (can be changed in the API)
- **Max Tokens**: 150 (configurable for different response lengths)
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (focused and consistent responses)

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**:

1. **Analysis not working**:
   - Check if text is long enough (10+ characters)
   - Verify API endpoint is accessible
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Slow responses**:
   - OpenAI API rate limits
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Server performance

3. **Incorrect analysis**:
   - Try different analysis types
   - Check if text is clear and complete
   - Verify API key permissions

## Contributing

To add new analysis types or improve the feature:

1. **Add new analysis type** in the API endpoint
2. **Update frontend** with new button and logic
3. **Test thoroughly** with various text types
4. **Update documentation** and examples
